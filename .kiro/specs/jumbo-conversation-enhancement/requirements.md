This specification addresses the critical issue of monotonous and non-contextual responses from Jumbo, the AI chatbot. Users have reported that Jumbo's responses lack personality, context awareness, and conversational depth, making interactions feel robotic and unsatisfying.

## Glossary

- **Jumbo_System**: The AI chatbot application providing mental health support
- **Response_Engine**: The component responsible for generating contextual responses
- **Memory_Context**: User-specific information including preferences, relationships, and conversation history
- **Personality_Layer**: The system component that ensures consistent, empathetic communication style
- **Context_Awareness**: The ability to reference and build upon previous conversations and user information
